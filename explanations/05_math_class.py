import math  # Module math.py with specific functions

# The math module in Python is of significant importance as it provides a wide range of mathematical functions and constants, allowing developers to perform complex mathematical operations with ease.

# Rounding numbers
print(round(6.6))  # Rounds 6.6 to the nearest integer
print(round(4.2))  # Rounds 4.2 to the nearest integer
print(round(9.5))  # Rounds 9.5 to the nearest integer

# Getting absolute values
print(abs(-52))  # Returns the absolute value of -52
print(abs(91))  # Returns the absolute value of 91

# Math module functionalities
print(math.ceil(1.1))  # Rounds up to the nearest integer
print(math.floor(1.99))  # Rounds down to the nearest integer
print(math.isnan(4.5))  # Checks if 4.5 is NaN - Not a Number
print(math.pow(10, 3))  # Raises 10 to the power of 3
print(math.sqrt(9))  # Returns the square root of 9
